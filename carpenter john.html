                <p>Franklin Yamoah Otchere, affectionately known as Frank or Kwabena, was born on Tuesday, 
                    May 31st, 1980, in Akropong Akuapem to Mr. Edward Okyere of Akropong Akuapem and Madam Salomey Nkrumah Yamoah of 
                    Akyem Awisa and Nsawam.He was the first child of the couple and the eldest of eight siblings.</p>
                <p>Frank spent his early childhood at Town Council Line in Laterbiokorshie, Accra, 
                    where he was raised by his devoted mother and his beloved grandfather, the late Mr. D. K. Yamoah. 
                    He began his basic education at Laterbiokorshie Primary School and continued to Abuakwa State College in Kyebi,
                    where he excelled academically and completed his secondary education with distinction.
                    His exceptional performance earned him admission into the Institute of Professional Studies- 
                    IPS (now the University of Professional Studies -UPSA, Accra), where he pursued a professional diploma in marketing.</p>
                <p>Frank's academic journey did not end there. 
                    He went on to obtain a Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Cape Coast,and later a Master of Science in 
                    Procurement and Supply Chain Management from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. 
                    His dedication to learning was reflected in the numerous professional development programs he attended,including training sessions by USAID, 
                    the World Bank, and the Ghana Health Service, among others.He became a certified member of various international associations in public health and logistics.</p>
                <p>Frank began his career with the Ghana Health Service as a Procurement Officer stationed at the Tema Station in Accra. His diligence, leadership, 
                    and deep sense of responsibility quickly earned him recognition.He was later promoted and transferred to the GHS headquarters in Tema, 
                    where he rose through the ranks to become a Senior Administrative Manager.</p>
                <p>In this role, he supervised procurement activities, executed World Bank and Global Fund projects, 
                    and supported national public health programs such as the National Malaria Control Programme and HIV/AIDS initiatives.</p>
                <p>With a sharp intellect and a heart for service, Frank was known for his integrity, interpersonal warmth, and professionalism.
                     Whether supervising large-scale logistics operations or training nurses in the use of supply chain systems, 
                     he approached every task with excellence and a sense of purpose. He was especially noted for his ability to lead with empathy, 
                     innovate in complex situations, and mentor younger colleagues.</p>
                <p>A devoted Christian, Frank was baptized at the Maxwell Dodoo Presbyterian Church in Laterbiokorshie and later joined the 
                    International Central Gospel Church (ICGC) Christ Temple and Evangel Temple in Laterbiokorshie and Tema respectively. 
                    His faith guided his life, and he spent countless hours in service to God and his community.</p>
                <p>Frank was also a proud father and family man. He welcomed his first son, Kelvin Kwame Yamoah, in 2019, 
                    he married Madam Jennifer Torsu of Tema, and together they were blessed with a daughter. 
                    His love for his family was evident in all he did—he was supportive, nurturing, and deeply involved in their lives.</p>
                <p>Known for his warm demeanor, generous spirit, and tireless work ethic, Frank touched the lives of many. 
                    He had a natural ability to bring people together, and his presence left an indelible mark on everyone he encountered.</p>
                <p>Franklin Yamoah Otchere departed this life on April 16th, 2025, after a short illness, at the age of 45. 
                    He leaves behind his beloved wife, two children, his parents, siblings, colleagues, and a wide circle of friends and loved ones. 
                    The loss is profound, but we take comfort in knowing that he held firm to his faith and purpose to the very end.</p>
                <p>Kwabena, your memory remains etched in our hearts. We commend you to your Maker. May the Holy Angels receive you in glory, 
                    and may your soul rest in perfect peace.</p>

            </figure>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>In times like these, the only hope that truly remains is in God—our Redeemer, 
                    our Comforter, and our Counselor. I am now faced with the painful reality of the death of my beloved husband—Bebe, 
                    as I affectionately called you.</p>
                <p>Death is a cruel and relentless enemy. Just when I needed you the most, 
                    just when your presence meant everything, you are no longer here. And so,
                     I take consolation from the Word of God, our pillar in all seasons:</p>
                <p>“The righteous perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; the devout are taken away, 
                    and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.
                    Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.” — Isaiah 57:1-2</p>
                <p>Today, as I stand here surrounded by family and friends, 
                    I find myself at a loss for words—how do I put into words the depth of my love for you, 
                    and the magnitude of the void you have left behind?</p>
                <p>You were more than a husband to me.You were my best friend, my confidant, my partner in all things, the love of my life.</p>
                <p>From the very moment we met, I knew there was something special about you.Your warmth, 
                    your laughter, the safety of your presence, and the way you cherished me—those were daily gifts that lit up my world. 
                    Even the ordinary moments became extraordinary with you. 
                    Whether we were holding hands during a walk, sharing a simple bottle of Coke, or sitting quietly in peace, 
                    every moment with you was a blessing.</p>
                <p>You were a man who gave selflessly and loved deeply—always putting family first.
                    You loved God dearly. You never finished a conversation without quoting scripture, 
                    and you served God faithfully, even unto your last breath.</p>
                <p>We shared so many precious memories. I will always cherish our quiet evenings watching Date Rush, 
                    laughing and debating over who would find love that night. 
                    I’ll miss the live band nights, dancing with you and soaking in the music like it was our private world.</p>
                <p>I'll miss our Sunday fufu traditions—it wasn't just a meal, it was a celebration of us.
                    I’ll miss taking candid photos of you and teasing you, and how you’d always smile and say, “People don’t know—but who will tell them?”</p>
                <p>You were right. People don’t know the depth of this pain—but who will tell them?</p>
                <p>When I lost my mother, I thought you would be here to console me.
                    Now you’re not. And I find myself alone—with no parents left to lean on.
                    Lady keeps asking me, “Where is my daddy?” and I don’t know how to answer her.I feel lost. I feel empty.</p>
                <p>But in the stillness of my broken heart, I carry your love with me.I see your smile in Lady’s face.
                    I hear your laughter in our memories.You are still with me—in every heartbeat, in every breath.</p>
                <p>Thank you, my love, for the beautiful life we built together.
                    Thank you for the joy, the laughter, the tears, and the countless moments that now live on in my soul.
                    Heaven has gained a sweet and gentle soul—and we, on earth, will never be the same.</p>
                <p>Kwabena, Nyame nfa wo kra nsie yie.<br>Kwabena, Dzidzo le nutifafa me.<br>Rest peacefully in the bosom of your Maker.<br>Amen.</p>

                    <p>Dad… your passing has left a silence in our lives that echoes louder than words can express. 
                       A vacuum impossible to fill. Yet, even in this silence, your memory speaks—loudly, clearly, lovingly.</p>
                    <p>You were a man of quiet strength and deep integrity. You always did what was right, even when it was hard. I remember you saying, 
                        “True strength isn't just physical—it's the courage to keep going, even when your heart is tired.” That has stayed with me.</p>
                    <p>Last week was Father's Day. How I wish you were still here for me to celebrate you in person—to laugh with you, hug you, 
                        and say thank you for the man you were. You were patient, loving, kind... and your influence has shaped the very core of who I am today. 
                        I will carry your words, your principles, and your gentle guidance with me for the rest of my life.</p>
                    <p>Kendra may be too little to fully understand now—just three years old—but Dad, we promise to keep your name alive in her heart. She may not have the years we had,
                         but she'll have the stories, the photos, the memories we'll share. She'll know you were a hero in the quietest, most beautiful ways.</p>
                    <P>We miss you so much, Dad. God knows how deeply I long for one more conversation… one more hug… one more moment to tell you all the things I didn't say.</P>
                    <p>Your life was a gift.<br>Your love, our shelter.<br>Your memory… our guiding light.</p>
                    <p>We love you, Dad. Forever.</p>
                    <p>Damirifa Due, Due ne Amanehunu.<br>Yaa wo ojogban.<br>Rest well, Dad. Rest in perfect peace.<br>Amen.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">“The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; the devout are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil. 
                    Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.” - Isaiah 57:1-2</span></p>
                <p>God looked around His garden and found an empty place. He looked down upon the earth and saw your tired face.
                     He put His arms around you and gently lifted you to rest. With the help of His angels, He carried you to your heavenly home.
                      God's garden must be beautiful—He always chooses the best.</p>
                <p>He knew you were weary. He saw your pain. He knew the road was getting rough and the hills too steep to climb. 
                    So He closed your eyes and whispered, “Peace be thine.”</p>
                <p>It broke our hearts to lose you, but you didn't go alone—a part of each of us went with you the day God called you home.
                     Brother Frank, day by day we think of you. How can this be real? How can it be that you are truly gone?</p>
                <p>Your passing was sudden—no farewell, no final words. We are heartbroken and shaken… but even in this grief, 
                    we hold on to the knowledge that your legacy will live on through each of us. We, your remaining siblings, will keep your memory alive.</p>
                <p>We mourn not just your absence, but the silence where your voice used to be, the warmth where your presence used to fill a room. 
                    Bishop, how we wish this gathering today were a celebration of your life in your presence, not a time of farewell.</p>
                <p>You have left a deep vacuum in our hearts—one that will be hard to fill—and a sorrow that words can barely contain.</p>
                <p>Yet, we take comfort in this truth:</p>
                <p>Kwabena, da yie.<br>Kwabena Yawo ojogban.<br>Bishop - rest in perfect peace.<br>Amen.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">“And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, sorrow, or crying. 
                    There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away.”Revelation 21:4</span></p>
                <p>Today, we come together with heavy hearts yet overflowing gratitude for the extraordinary life of our dear colleague, 
                    Mr. Franklin Yamoah Otchere. His loss is immeasurable for all of us in the SSDM Division at Ghana Health Service Headquarters. 
                    Franklin was more than a colleague; he was a brother, a true friend, and a source of inspiration for each of us.</p>
                <p>His sudden passing, following a brief illness, is a profound loss for us all. Franklin, affectionately known as “Bishop,
                    ” demonstrated tremendous dedication in his work. He approached his responsibilities with diligence, 
                    and his unwavering commitment to the success of our Division and the Ghana Health Service Supply Chain will never be forgotten.</p>
                <p>Despite his intellect and influence, he remained incredibly humble, always approachable, 
                    and never sought recognition. His intelligence, sacrifices, 
                    and love became even more evident when he assumed the role of President of our noble association, 
                    HESSCPAG, where he opened the door to inclusivity.</p>
                <p>He was always the first to offer a helping hand, providing support, guidance, and a compassionate ear whenever needed. 
                    We will greatly miss those team lunches and our get-together meetings, where he would lighten the mood with his jokes. 
                    He had a talent for poking fun and making everyone feel at ease. He was truly fun to be around.</p>
                <p>He was a man of great value, serving as our counselor, a prayer warrior, and a teacher. 
                    His faith was evident in his actions and gentle spirit, demonstrating a deep spirituality. 
                    One of his greatest joys was singing; his enthusiasm for life, often expressed through song, was infectious and always brightened our days.</p>
                <p>The gap he leaves in our Division and the GHS supply chain family is vast. 
                    We will mourn his wisdom, unwavering support, and beautiful spirit.</p>
                <p>Mr. Franklin Yamoah Otchere has left a lasting impression on our lives, 
                    not just through his substantial contributions to the Ghana Health Service, 
                    but also through the deep friendships he formed and the warmth he brought to our daily lives.</p>
                <p>As we reflect on Franklin’s legacy, we cherish his dedication to excellence in his work, 
                    where he demonstrated outstanding leadership and encouraged collaboration among team members. 
                    His ability to inspire those around him will continue to guide us in our pursuits.</p>
                <p>It’s not about how long you live, but how well you live. We consider you a champion because of your bravery! 
                    Your desire to see others grow and prosper reflects a truly pure spirit. We will dearly miss you as a member of our fraternity.</p>
                <p>Bishop, Gaza, Onukpa, you will forever remain in our hearts. We love you dearly, and your absence will be profoundly felt.</p>
                <p>Rest in peace, dear brother, friend, colleague, and leader.<br>Your legacy of kindness, dedication and love will live in our hearts until we meet again!!!!<br>
                    Fare thee well, Bishop!!!!</p>

                <p>It is with profound sorrow and deep regret that we, the members of the Health Sector Supply Chain Professionals Association of Ghana (HESSCPAG), 
                    pay tribute to our esteemed former National President, Franklin Yamoah Otchere. His untimely passing has left an unfillable void in our organization,
                     and his absence will be deeply felt by all who knew him.</p>
                <p>Under Franklin’s visionary leadership, HESSCPAG witnessed unprecedented growth and development. 
                    His unwavering commitment to excellence, integrity, and compassion inspired a generation of supply chain professionals in the health sector. 
                    His gentle yet firm guidance helped shape the Association into the strong and respected body it is today.</p>
                <p>As a mentor, Franklin was unparalleled. His calm strength, humility, and willingness to listen made him a beloved figure among his peers and colleagues.
                     His dedication to our profession was tireless, and his passion for excellence was contagious. He was a true champion of progress, 
                     always pushing boundaries and seeking innovative solutions to complex challenges.</p>
                <p>Franklin’s legacy extends far beyond his tenure as National President. His impact on HESSCPAG will be felt for generations to come, 
                    as his vision, values, and principles continue to guide us. We take comfort in the knowledge that his contributions to our Association will endure, 
                    even as we mourn his passing.</p>
                <p>On behalf of the entire HESSCPAG family, we extend our deepest condolences to Franklin’s family, friends, and loved ones. 
                    May they find solace in the memories of his remarkable life and the knowledge that his legacy will live on through us.</p>
                <p>Rest well, comrade Franklin. You are forever in our hearts, and your memory willcontinue to inspire us to greater heights.</p>
